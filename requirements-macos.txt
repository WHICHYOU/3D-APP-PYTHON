# macOS-specific requirements
# For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) with MPS acceleration

# Standard PyTorch with MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) support
# This provides GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0

# Note: MPS support is automatic in PyTorch 2.0+
# The application will automatically detect and use MPS if available

# For Intel Macs:
# MPS is not available, will fall back to CPU
# Performance will be significantly slower

# All other dependencies are in requirements.txt
# Install order:
#   1. pip install -r requirements.txt
#   2. pip install -r requirements-macos.txt
