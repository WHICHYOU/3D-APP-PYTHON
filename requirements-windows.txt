# Windows-specific requirements with CUDA support
# For NVIDIA GPU acceleration (Recommended for Windows)

# Install PyTorch with CUDA 12.1 support
# This provides GPU acceleration for depth estimation
--index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0

# Alternative: CPU-only version (slower, but works without NVIDIA GPU)
# Uncomment these and comment out the above if you don't have an NVIDIA GPU:
# --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
# torch>=2.0.0
# torchvision>=0.15.0

# Note: For AMD GPUs on Windows, CUDA support is limited.
# CPU version is recommended for AMD systems.

# All other dependencies are in requirements.txt
# Install order:
#   1. pip install -r requirements.txt
#   2. pip install -r requirements-windows.txt
